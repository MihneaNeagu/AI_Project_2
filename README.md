Optimization Problems Solver
Project Overview:
This project aims to solve two classic optimization problems: the Knapsack Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The Knapsack Problem will be tackled using the Tabu Search algorithm, while the TSP will be addressed using the Simulated Annealing algorithm.

Problem Descriptions:
Knapsack Problem (KP): The Knapsack Problem is a combinatorial optimization problem where a set of items with weights and values must be selected to maximize the total value while not exceeding a given weight limit.

Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): The Traveling Salesman Problem involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

Solution Approaches:
Knapsack Problem (Tabu Search): The Tabu Search algorithm will be employed to solve the Knapsack Problem. Tabu Search is a metaheuristic search method used for solving optimization problems, inspired by the process of how molecules move in liquids.

Traveling Salesman Problem (Simulated Annealing): The Simulated Annealing algorithm will be utilized to address the Traveling Salesman Problem. Simulated Annealing is a probabilistic optimization algorithm inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, where a material is heated and then cooled to achieve its desired crystalline structure.
